# The Covid-19-Tableau-Project

I have been working on building my data visualization skills and I chose Tableau as a tool for telling stories with data. Tableau is one of the powerful data visualization tools and it is also used in business intelligence, marketing, and more fields. It is used not only for visualizing the data but also for hypothesis testing, feature engineering, dash-boarding, and storytelling, which are very important parts of a data science project.

# Building a COVID-19 Dashboard:
One of the best examples of effective and interactive dashboards could be the recent COVID-19 dashboards. It is the basis of how we are seeing and measuring the impact of this virus in the world. This is a great example of using data to educate the masses based on finding insights and educate them through visuals.
I Created dynamic visualization using tableau to track the real-time Confirmed and Death Cases By Location.

I took the World-Level Data from the CDC Website and connected the data through Web Data Connector. Web data connectors can be a versatile tools to let you connect to many different possible data sources across the web. Lots of popular websites give access to free APIs that can be convenient to connect to from Tableau rather than perhaps having to download all the website’s data and hosting it locally to run your analytics on.

It has the daily number of cases nationwide, on the country level and state level as well. My main aim is to focus the audience’s attention on the number of cases, and details based on the different countries and the details of each state based upon the user’s interest. The data can tell which country have the most and least number of cases and deaths. There is one dashboard, which shows the entire view of the world where you can see the total number of cases and deaths overall. On the right side of the dashboard, you can see the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases and 10 states with the highest number of death rate. I have also showed the linear as well as the log graph for both the confirmed cases as well as death cases.

Now you can see the world dashboard and click on countries to get the granular details. This is the working of my COVID-19 dashboard. 
## Here is a link to the dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/profile/archita.jain#!/vizhome/Coronavirus_Cases/Dashboard1

You can play with the dashboard and I would love to hear your feedback or suggestions on this one.
